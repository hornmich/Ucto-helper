# Ucto-helper
An application for automatical forms filling, generated by Účto software.

This application is designed to make an accountace life easier. Right now, the Účto software
generates forms with empty billing periods and unspecified state of signature in it. The accountace have
to manually elide the invalid selection The payer has signed/not signed ... and manually write the billing period
to the appropriate fields.

This application takes the text or HTML output of the Účto software, ask the user for the signature state
and process the form in the way that the output has the signature state selected and billing period filled
in the right way.

The application understands several options, so the whole work can be scripted. Also a GUI frontend is going to be
released soon.
